## Destructing Arrays

- Destructing is (ES6 feature) a way of unpacking values from an array or an object into separate variables. Is breaking complex data structure down into smaller data structure like a variable.
- In arrays we use destructing to retreive values from an array and store them in variables in a simple way.
- `const nested = [2, 4, [5, 6]]; const [i, , j] = nested;console.log(i, j);`

## Destructing Objects

- We use curly braces({})
