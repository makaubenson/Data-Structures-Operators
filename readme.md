## Destructing Arrays

- Destructing is (ES6 feature) a way of unpacking values from an array or an object into separate variables. Is breaking complex data structure down into smaller data structure like a variable.
- In arrays we use destructing to retreive values from an array and store them in variables in a simple way.
